                <h2>Face Recognition Model</h2>
                <p>Facial recognition serves as the backbone of our Smart Voting Through Facial Recognition system, ensuring secure and reliable authentication of voters. Let's delve into how this technology functions:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Initialization and Setup: The facial recognition process begins by initializing the necessary components. Utilizing the OpenCV library, we capture video frames, detect faces, and display real-time results.</li>
                    <li>Face Detection and Encoding: Upon receiving video frames, our system employs a face detection algorithm to locate faces. Detected faces undergo feature extraction and encoding into numerical representations.</li>
                    <li>Comparison with Known Faces: Encoded facial features are compared with known faces stored in the system. This involves calculating the Euclidean distance to determine similarity.</li>
                    <li>Recognition and Decision Making: Based on calculated distances, the system determines if a match exists. If within a predefined threshold, the face is recognized, and appropriate actions are taken.</li>
                    <li>Visualization and User Interaction: Throughout the process, the system provides visual feedback by drawing bounding boxes around detected faces. This enhances user experience and ensures transparency.</li>
                    <li>Conclusion and Cleanup: Upon completion or timeout, the system releases resources and closes OpenCV windows, ensuring proper cleanup.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Facial recognition technology plays a crucial role in modernizing the voting experience, enhancing integrity, and ensuring accessibility in the electoral process.</p>
